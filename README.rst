SmartDFM
=======

**SmartDFM** is a Python application that provides feedback to composite component designer, based on set of design rules.

The most up-to-date documentation should be available in docs/build/html/index.html. This should be deployed on GitHub, but if it is not, it should be displayable locally.

The original Wiki is still available at <https://nationalcompositescentre.sharepoint.com/sites/Wiki/SitePages/CoSinC-WP4.2-Smart-DFM.aspx> for NCC's internal users.
