CompoST
=======

Compost is a standardised method for storing composite information. https://github.com/National-Composites-Centre/CompoST

The integration is currently don by simply placing the complete set of standardised classes under 'FactBase.StandardLayup' object. This superceeds other composited definition native to SmartDFM.

Of course, some bespoke requirements will be needed but the intention is to avoid duplication. Therefre where CompoST definition is sufficient SmartDFM uses those objects (from version 4.0 onwards)
