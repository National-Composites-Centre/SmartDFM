Versions
========

1.1 Initial release with PySimpleGUI. This is being altered due to PySimpleGUI goign commercial.

2.0 Kivy based replacement of PySimpleGUI.

3.0 Due to minor issues with all Python GUI libraries, this version contains no GUI at all, allowing for this to be build later. The SmartDFM is initiated by loading the appropriate model in CATIA and specifying folder in noGUI_run.py , and running that script.

4.0 Moving away from .txt based definition of layup, using JSON standard from https://github.com/National-Composites-Centre/CompoST.

4.2 Includes Kivy GUI again, albeit with very limited functionality.
