Layup database
==============

LD_layup_database.txt

There is an option of hooking-up SQL database in place of the .txt file. This is in many way superior option, but for the default demonstrator version it was deemed easier to work with .txt material database. For the use of SQL database use excursor.py, IDP_databases.py , SQL_methods_backup.py, and edited version of sql_config.txt. These files are currently stored in "unused" sub-folder. This will need to be connected and disconneced in pre-rules where materials are referenced.
